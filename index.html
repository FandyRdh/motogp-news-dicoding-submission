                    <h4 class="sub-title">Circuit Information</h4>
                    <h2>Circuit de la Sarthe - 	Le Mans, France</h2>
                    <p>The circuit's origins pre-date its most famous race, however. The first races were held in 1920, when the UMF (Union Motocycliste de France) organised a motorcycle grand prix on a triangular course from the Pontlieue suburbs of Le Mans, along public roads to Mulsanne and back again. In total the circuit measured more than 10 miles and proved a machinery-breaker; of the 31 starters, only four were still running at race's end.</p>
                    <p>Motorcycle races continued under the auspices of the UMF and the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) but in 1922, the idea for the 24 hours was born. The secretary of the ACO, Georges Durand, received an unexpected offer of 100,000 francs from the French subsidiary of the Rudge Whitworth wheels company. This was to help facilitate a suitable race, with the money becoming a prize fund for the winner. A free hand was given as to the nature of the race.</p>

                        <h2>Sprint Race </h2>
                        <p>Jorge Martin strengthened his title lead with a lights-to-flag victory in the 2024 French MotoGP Sprint race, amidst considerable drama behind him. Starting from a record pole position time, Martin comfortably held his advantage into Turn 1 while Francesco Bagnaia, who started alongside him, was swamped off the line and plummeted to 15th. Things got even worse for the Jerez winner and reigning champion, who later ran through the gravel—presumably due to an ongoing technical issue—and eventually retired his Ducati from the last place.<p>
                        <p>Another frontrunner to suffer an early setback was Aprilia's Aleix Espargaro, penalized with a double long-lap penalty for jumping the start while in third place. Meanwhile, Marc Marquez, starting 13th after failing to progress past his first Ducati visit to Qualifying 1, darted around his rivals to reach fourth place by the end of the opening lap. That became a podium place when Espargaro served his first long lap, with only Martin and Bezzecchi still ahead of #93. Marquez was starting to inch towards fellow GP23 rider Bezzecchi when the VR46 competitor suddenly lost the front on entry to the Esses with four laps to go.</p>

                        <h2>Main Race </h2>
                        <p>Jorge Martin held off Marc Marquez and Francesco Bagnaia by half a second to win the 2024 French MotoGP at Le Mans, in front of 119,145 fans. Marquez, starting from 13th, caught the leading duo with seven laps to go, just after Martin had finally dislodged Bagnaia from the front. The Pramac rider kept just out of range until a mistake with three laps to go put Bagnaia on his exhaust pipe, with Marquez only a few bike lengths behind. Despite crashing while leading at the previous Jerez Grand Prix, Martin kept his composure.</p>
                        <p>On the final lap, it was Bagnaia who lost out as Marquez, seeking some revenge for his Jerez defeat, passed the reigning champion under braking to finish 0.446 seconds behind Martin. The #89 smashed his screen with delight as he crossed the line, completing a perfect Le Mans double following his Sprint win. Bagnaia had overcome his previous day's start misery and early retirement by grabbing the holeshot from pole qualifier Martin, with the pair remaining locked together and shadow-boxing for lap after lap.</p>
